            <p class="content-paragraph">Roasting brings out the aroma and flavor locked inside the green coffee beans. The most common roasts are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Light Roast:</strong> Toasted grain taste, with a pronounced acidity.</li>
                <li><strong>Medium Roast:</strong> Balanced flavor, aroma, and acidity.</li>
                <li><strong>Dark Roast:</strong> A bittersweet, smoky taste, with less acidity.</li>
            </ul>
